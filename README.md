# ProjectSearch
This is a pseudo-search engine which goes through notes and gives answers to questions.
This project is still in its planning Phase.
We expect to make a python program which takes notes in `.txt` format and ask for questions and answer them.

## Current Deliverables
[ ] make a parser for parsing `.txt` files
[ ] take questions as input and also the marking for the question
[ ] make a tf-idf algorithm to rank the sentences
[ ] and return those sentences

## Deadline 
 We expect to complete this project before March 2021
