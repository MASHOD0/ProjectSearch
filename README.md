# ProjectSearch
This is a pseudo-search engine which goes through notes and gives answers to questions.
This project is work in progress(the code works).
We expect to make a python program which takes notes in `.txt` format and ask for questions and answer them.

## Instructions to run the code
1. make a python virtual environment by running this command in the terminal.
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
2. activate the virtual environment by running this command
```
source venv/Scripts/activate
```
3. install all the required packages
```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```
4. run the code .
```
python3 src/main corpus
```







## Current Deliverables
- [x] take an input from `.txt` files and 
- [x] take questions as input and also the marking for the question
- [x] make a tf-idf algorithm to rank the sentences
- [x] and return those sentences

## Deadline 
 We expect to complete this project before March 2021
