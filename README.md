# ProjectSearch
This is a pseudo-search engine which goes through notes and gives answers to questions.
This project is work in progress(the code works).
We expect to make a python program which takes notes in `.txt` format and ask for questions and answer them.

## Current Deliverables
- [x] take an input from `.txt` files and 
- [x] take questions as input and also the marking for the question
- [x] make a tf-idf algorithm to rank the sentences
- [x] and return those sentences

## Deadline 
 We expect to complete this project before March 2021
